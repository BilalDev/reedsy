## 1. About you

> Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Node.js and/or AngularJS.

I would like to talk about my first project I had to do with AngularJS and Node.js. It was a web application dedicated to ophthalmology. Initialy developed with Symfony and TWIG there was a lot of performance issue. So I recommended to switch from this stack to an AngularJS / Node.js application. At first I've chosen to migrate the API written in PHP to Node.js. All the APIs were testable using mocha/chai and documented with swagger. Then I started to re-write the front with AngularJS 1.5 at the time. This was the first project I had to do with this stack and since, I love to rewrite or design these type of application.
